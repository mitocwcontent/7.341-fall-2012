description: The best example of using microorganisms to make useful products is in
  the production of alcoholic beverages like wine and beer. With the advent of molecular
  biology and modern genetic techniques, we can optimize alcohol and flavor compound
  biosynthesis in the organisms that are typically used for alcoholic beverage production.
